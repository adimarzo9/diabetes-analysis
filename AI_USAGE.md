### AI Usage in this Project

This document describes how AI tools and platforms were used during the development of this project.

# GitHub Copilot

GitHub was primarily used for:

- Debugging : To track issues, understand errors, and manage code revisions.
- Dependency management : To help add new necessary libraries to the project dependencies.
- Linking my work to my Github account and manage my repository to be able to share it for grading.

# ChatGPT

ChatGPT was used to assist with differents tasks of the project:

- Debugging : To track issues, understand errors, and manage code revisions.
- Code writing : It helped me write the code and structure the functions.
- Linking my work to my Github account and manage my repository to be able to share it for grading.
- General support : To provide explanations, clarify steps, and suggest solutions throughout the development of this project.
- Report writing : It assisted me in the writing of the technical report and help me with the LaTex template on overleaf to use it more efficiently.

# Cursor

The Cursor AI agent was used to assist me with :

- Debugging : To track issues, understand errors, and manage code revisions.
- Code writing : It helped me write the code and structure the functions.

# Notes

- All code and text generated with the help of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT and Cursor) were reviewed and adapted manually to ensure the project englobes all requirements.
- AI tools were used as assistant and support and did not replace my own work.
